    <h3> Technical Skills </h3>
    <p class="tech_paragraph">
        I have gained experience working with different types of lab equipment
        and following different safety procedures and protocols. Being able to
        use the tools to apply theoretical knowledge to practical solutions is
        an important skill to have, and helps bring many different ideas into
        fruition. My technical skills include being able to use lab equipment to
        run various tests, coding in different programming languages, and
        building physical circuits that I have designed.
