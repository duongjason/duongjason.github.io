    <h3> Volunteer Work </h3>
    <p class="volunteer_paragraph">
        What I love most about the city is the opportunity to give back to my
        community. I take pride in being more than just an electrical and
        computer engineer. My passion for electronics is clear, but I also value
        the power of human connection and being able to help those that are
        either less fortunate than me or help with events that inspire the
        Asian-American community. Growing up, my family has always emphasized
        kindness and willingness to serve others. I have followed my mom's
        advice all my life. It doesn't matter how smart, how talented, or how
        hard-working I am. It is more important to prioritize my relationships
        with other people and to always stay humble.

          What I love about the Red Cross is how much influence they have all
          over the world and how charitable their efforts have been. Through the
          Red Cross, I have worked with others in different communities and
          reached out to improve their lives. I have helped organize different
          walks for my high school such as the breast cancer walk and Light the
          Night, raised money for different fundraisers such as selling used
          books to locals, and helped set up events for various communities. I
          have improved the camraderie among my classmates by making sure the
          events are exciting and people feel as if they are doing meaningful
          work. I woke up very early many days to take the subway for hours at a
          time into different boroughs just to set everything up before other
          volunteers arrived.

          At the New York Aquarium, I was a volunteer docent after Hurricane
          Sandy devastated the Coney Island area, a place dear to my heart.
          There, I trained for weeks before educating families and their
          children about marine wildlife, Coney Island's aquatic animals, and
          the penguin and coral exhibits. I helped with the sea lion aquatheater
          shows and also inspired the community by working at the touch tank and
          teaching people to care about the animals. In doing so, I tried
          helping bring the community together through a love for wildlife and
          education. Along the way, I gained confidence speaking with others and
          developed creative ways to convey information to visitors through the
          use of artifacts. I also took initiative with a group of my close
          friends and raised over $400 for the New York Aquarium in their
          rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Sandy. It was known as "Bubbles for
          Charity", where we set up tied ropes and buckets of soap on the
          boardwalk. As people walked by, they could make as many large bubbles
          as they wanted and donate however much money they could to the
          aquarium. I not only gained valuable time and budget management
          skills, but I also learned how effective such a small idea could be
          and how willing the community was to come together in times of need.

      <h3> Chinatown Youth Initiative </h3>

          Growing up as an Asian American in New York, I've always felt a sense
          of belonging in Chinatown. That was why I felt it was so important to
          give back to the Asian American community and help set up events that
          would bring us closer together. I've helped set up fairs that families
          could go to, where their children would enjoy different inflatable
          obstacles, parents could sit around, relax, and enjoy the atmosphere,
          and competitive spirits could play different games including
          life-sized Chinese chess. Because Chinatown is so densely populated,
          there is a lot of garbage and litter on the ground especially after
          major holidays such as Chinese New Year. I have taken time out to help
          clean up the community with others while enjoying the festivities and
          donating money to the lion dancers that put on performances. I have
          also attended different open mic sessions hosted by the teen resource
          center to inspire confidence in others and show that the arts are just
          as important as STEM fields. I would put on different dances and also
          support other Asian Americans by staying for their performances. I was
          exposed to amazing live music, very talented poets, and learned about
          both the struggles and successes of people growing up as Asian
          Americans.
