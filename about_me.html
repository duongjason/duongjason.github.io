    <h3> About Me </h3>
    <p class="about_paragraph">
        I am an open-minded and ambitious individual with a passion for many
        different things. A big reason why I decided to dedicate my life to
        electrical and computer engineering was because of the aftermath of
        Hurricane Sandy. After the storm hit, I realized how dependent both my
        family and my community were on electricity. Without it, it was
        difficult to keep food fresh, get around to different places, and
        communicate with others over the phone. Some of the houses my friends
        lived in were devastated, and I saw too many families struggle to get by
        without electricity. I was driven to help as much as I could, and it
        really pushed me to learn about electricity and why it was so pervasive
        in society. My parents were supportive in my decision and always
        inspired me to choose my own path. The fact that electronics worked
        fascinated me, and studying at Cornell was the perfect opportunity for
        me to give back to my community.

    <p class="about_paragraph">
        But I am also more than just my major. I love to do activities outside
        of engineering and working on my own projects, including playing
        basketball, playing guitar, singing, and dancing. In high school, I
        found out I had a passion for hip-hop and breakdancing, and I always
        made sure I took time to practice my footwork. I try to remain as active
        as I can and plan my work around my physical activities. It is easier to
        be mentally alert if I am physically healthy, so I prioritize my health
        first. I also like making origami paper cranes and taking photographs in
        my spare time, as I enjoy the balance they provide in my life. Here are
        some photos I have taken around my neighborhood.

    </div>

    <p class="about_paragraph">
        Like most people, I also enjoy listening to music and reading Harry
        Potter books. Keeping in touch with my friends is also very important,
        so I always make time to catch up with them during breaks or when I'm
        available. My family is also very important, and I make it a point to
        avoid using technology when I am spending time with them. I try to enjoy
        the moments I can and I really cherish my relationships with other
        people.
