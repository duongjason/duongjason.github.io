    <h3> Past Work Experience </h3>
    <p class="exp_paragraph">
      Being able to apply theoretical knowledge to make real-life business
      decisions is an important skill to have. I have experience working in the
      software and aerospace industries, both which require high creativity and
      resourcefulness. Over the past few years, I have enhanced my technical
      proficiency, gaining hands-on experience with lab equipment, creating
      designs for both hardware and software applications, and finding solutions
      to very complicated problems. But in addition to that, I have also gained
      experience writing technical papers, developing test procedures, and
      communicating with co-workers and other companies effectively. As an
      electrical and computer engineer, I understand that not only is it
      prescribed to have the relevant technical skills, but it is also critical
      to foster a professional and dynamic relationship with my co-workers to
      ensure a positive work environment. My work experience has given me the
      tools to make an immediate positive impact, both technically and
      professionally.

    <p class="company"> Insitu, Hood River, Oregon </p>
    <p class="occupation"> Hardware Electronics Intern </p>

    <p class="exp_paragraph">
        It was here where I learned the ins and outs of the aerospace industry.
        During my time at Insitu, I worked on multiple projects that directly
        affected the quality and production of the engine board for one of the
        unmanned aircraft systems. In the field, it is important that the system
        operates well under different environmental stresses, including but not
        limited to factors such as heat, temperature, humidity, and proximity to
        natural obstacles. Thus, it was crucial that I performed a part stress
        analysis on different components on the engine board, as one failure
        could be catastrophic for the aircraft. During the analysis, I
        characterized different properties such as power dissipation, applied
        voltages, and derating specifications. By cultivating my attention to
        detail and handling so many different board components responsibly, I
        made finding causes of failure much more efficient and gained the trust
        of my peers when doing rigorous circuit analysis. Here is a photo of
        an unmanned aircraft system on a launcher, prepared for flight.

    <p class="exp_paragraph">
        In addition to much of the theoretical work done, I also worked with the
        actual engine board in the laboratory. I performed many different tests
        to ensure the functionality of the engine board, including continuity
        and resistivity tests, sensor monitoring, voltage probing, and firmware
        calibration. In doing so, I developed a functional acceptance test
        procedure that made it possible for my co-workers and board vendors to
        reproduce the exact same tests that I performed. This guaranteed
        consistency when testing the boards and defined the standards that
        engine boards were expected to operate at after being manufactured. The
        acceptance test procedure helped expose problems on different engine
        boards, such as certain voltage rails not being met or parts of a
        circuit that weren't functioning properly.
    </p>

    <p class="exp_paragraph">
        To improve the quality of the test setup, I also worked on a project
        that simulated the engine board circuitry while connected to a fuel
        pump. I designed and built a circuit that used the engine board as a
        model, effectively eliminating the need for excess cabling and huge
        power supplies that would otherwise clutter the lab benches. Instead, it
        required a small CPU power supply and interfaced with an NI data
        acquistion system. Using high-frequency analysis, I specified different
        inductors, resistors, and capacitors required for filtering in the
        circuit, incorporated design changes to protect the power supply against
        kickback voltages, and performed a power analysis to ensure the
        components used were rated properly. In the process, I gained a lot of
        experience soldering onto perf-boards, working with network connections,
        and optimizing the cost of all the components required in the system.
    </p>

    <p class="exp_paragraph">
        When working with engine boards, it is also important to consider the
        deterioration that occurs after months or years of operation. The wear
        and tear can cause damage to different components, and the aircraft can
        go down when least expected. To address this, I drafted a procedure to
        perform highly accelerated life testing, HALT, on the engine board. This
        is the process of stressing the board to its destruct limits, points at
        which all functionality is lost even after returning to operational
        limits. I included procedures for hot and cold temperature step
        stresses, vibrational tests, rapid thermal ramps, voltage and current
        margining, and input signal timing manipulation. Factors that I
        considered included things such as temperature dwell rate, different
        times to power cycle, and performing a verification HALT test to
        validate any solutions proposed.

    <p class="company"> Mirai IT Solutions, New York, New York </p>
    <p class="occupation"> Software Engineering Intern </p>

    <p class="exp_paragraph">
        At Mirai IT Solutions, I learned a lot about Android app development and
        working with Java object-oriented programming to create a point of sale
        system. By implementing the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural
        pattern, I used a broadcast platform to facilitate communication between
        activities and fragments in the application. This gave the system
        modularity, making debugging more efficient and the code easier to
        analyze. In developing the app, I also made considerations regarding the
        structure of the code and the actual layout of the app. I designed
        different Java classes with standard naming and commenting conventions,
        allowing others to easily understand the coding concept and design.
    </p>

    <p class="exp_paragraph">
        To provide full functionality of the point of sale system, I created a
        SQL server database and established a reliable connection between the
        server and the Android application. The database included many different
        items that were served by the restaurant, and I helped with
        categorization to make navigation of the system easier. This database
        held all of the information required by the application, including
        things such as price, food type, and customer numbers. Because the
        values for these different categories could change with time, such as
        the price of food increasing, I programmed the code dynamically. Thus,
        any changes in the database would automatically be updated in the
        application, providing an extra layer of separation between the user and
        the back-end.
    </p>

    <p class="exp_paragraph">
        I also did a lot of work with front-end development by producing XML
        files that reflected the design of the written code on an Android
        device. I changed the attributes of different fragments, laid out
        different buttons on the screen so that they would be aesthetically
        pleasing, and included tables that would update upon tapping these
        buttons on the device. This made the application user-friendly,
        especially important when used in energetic settings such as
        restaurants.
    </p>

    <p class="exp_paragraph">
        An important aspect of the internship was also learning to present my
        ideas to other people. I gained a lot of experience working with
        PowerPoint and communicating with others who didn't speak the same
        language as me. This helped me focus on the important points of my
        application and create diagrams that explained what I was trying to
        accomplish with the code despite the language barrier.
