      The name's Jason, a 4th year college student currently studying
      Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. Raised in
      Brooklyn, the city that never sleeps is where I draw much of my
      inspiration. I believe that in order to truly appreciate well-crafted
      hardware or elegantly-designed software code, it is always important
      to see the underlying design. Developing these technological platforms
      takes motivation, ambition, and hard-work, qualities I exhibit both
      consistently and comfortably in any environment. Whether I am
      designing and analyzing electrical systems or volunteering in my
      community, my passion for electronics grounds me and remains my
      foundation.

    <p class="home_paragraph">
      During the summer this past year, I interned at a company called
      Insitu. Insitu is a subsidiary of The Boeing Company focused on
      designing, developing, and supporting unmanned aircraft systems in the
      aerospace industry. Here is some of the work I did:
    </p>

    <ul class="home_paragraph">
      <li> Developed an acceptance test procedure to verify functionality
           of engine board for unmanned aircraft systems, including
           continuity andd resistivity tests, sensor monitoring, voltage
           measurements, and firmware calibration. </li>
      <li> Designed filters for engine board circuitry using high-frequency
           analysis, protected power supplies against kickback voltages
           through the use of fuses, and performed power analysis on
           various circuit components. </li>
      <li> Performed part stress analysis to characterize things such as
           power dissipation and voltage applications. </li>
      <li> Became familiar with highly accelerated life testing and drafted
           a procedure outlining the process for the engine board. </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="home_paragraph">
      I have also been working on my own pair of portable speakers, hopefully
      ones that are loud enough to listen to while playing basketball outdoors.
      I make use of the LM386 low voltage audio power amplifier powered by a
      9V battery supply. The speakers used have an impedance of 8Ohms and a
      power rating of 1W, enough to listen to them comfortably in large rooms. I
      am incorporating design changes with time, thinking about where certain
      bypass capacitors should go to remove high frequency oscillations or how
      to properly protect the speakers by AC coupling the output of the
      amplifier. I would also like to include Bluetooth capability and work with
      a microcontroller such as the Arduino to provide indicator LEDs that flash
      with the beat of a song.
